Adds 6 directional gravity to entities with variable strength.

Directions include: Up, Down, North, East, South, and West.

Direction defaults to Down.

Strength causes gravity to pull entities stronger or weaker when positive, when negitive it acts like antigravity and repels, and when zero, there is no gravity.

Strength defaults at 1, with higher values stronger and lower values weaker.

Negative gravity will make entities fall as if their direction is opposite, but still be flipped the same direction visually.
In this case, entities like dinnerbone would have a Negative Up gravity.

Zero gravity prevents horizontal movement by default.

Plans:
- Special, swimming based, vector gravity for gravity
